# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)

**Github Pages**

[Link to the project via Github Pages] (https://tereda92.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus) I've tried everything from relinking the file paths in the html and css folders, I've tried deleting the images and readding them with different names, i've commited each change to see what effect it has on the webpage link, in my live version the webpage looks fantastic but this link doesn't reflect what is actually in my code. I've run out of ideas for how to fix this issue i'm at a loss hopefully you can comment what you think may be the problem with the way the github pages link is displaying. It's different from browser to browser....I'm at a loss....... SEEMS TO BE MISSING EDIT, HEART, AND ADD BUTTON although I feel everything is organized and linked correctly.

## Plan on improving the project

- Videos get confusing when different tutors have different classes & selectors I would recommend having just one tutor explain an entire project from start to finish if theres going to be videos to go off of.
