# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

## Plan on improving the project

- Videos get confusing when different tutors have different classes & selectors I would recommend having just one tutor explain an entire project from start to finish if theres going to be videos to go off of.
