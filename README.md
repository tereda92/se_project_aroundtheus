# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Github Pages**

[Link to the project via Github Pages] (https://tereda92.github.io/DAMIANS-SPRINT-3-Project-FIGMA) I'm aware the link is broken I have a meeting with Kevin Loughead in the morning regarding this issue as well as an issue I'm having with my projects constantly unlinking from their repositories and projects being deleted by themselves as well, it has been a recurring issue for me since starting this program.

## Plan on improving the project

- Videos get confusing when different tutors have different classes & selectors I would recommend having just one tutor explain an entire project from start to finish if theres going to be videos to go off of.
